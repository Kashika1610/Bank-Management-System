The improvised code retains the functionality and structure of the original code but
improves readability and maintainability by following best coding practices. Here are the
main improvements made to the code:

                                                       DESCRIPTION


1. Reduced Using Namespace Scope: In the original code, the entire `std` namespace was
imported with `using namespace std;`. In the improvised code, we've limited the use of
`using namespace std;` to the specific parts of the code where it is necessary, reducing the
risk of naming conflicts.

2. Modular Classes: The classes have been structured clearly with appropriate encapsulation
of data members and methods. This makes the code more maintainable and easier to
understand.

3. Consistent Naming and Commenting: Descriptive names have been used for classes,
variables, and functions, enhancing code readability. Additionally, meaningful comments
have been provided to explain the purpose of classes and methods.

4. Separation of Concerns: Each class now has a well-defined responsibility, such as the
`Date` class for handling dates, the `Address` class for addresses, and the `Bank` class for
managing accounts. This separation of concerns follows the Single Responsibility Principle.

5. Inheritance and Polymorphism: The use of inheritance and method overriding has been
properly demonstrated with the `SavingsAccount` and `CheckingAccount` classes, which
inherit from the base `Account` class. This allows for a more elegant and extensible design.

6. Consistent Indentation: Proper indentation and formatting have been maintained
throughout the code, enhancing its readability.

7. Clarity in Account Initialization: The creation of customer and account objects is now
more straightforward, with clear parameters and object creation.

8. Error Messages: Clear error messages have been provided in case of insufficient balance
or overdraft limit violation.

9. Modularized Actions: The code separates the actions of deposit, withdrawal, and interest
calculation into well-defined methods for each account type, making it easier to add or
modify functionality in the future.

10. Clear Listing of Account Information: The `Bank` class now lists account numbers and
balances in a clear and organized manner.

These improvements make the code more maintainable, readable, and adaptable for future

enhancements or modifications. It adheres to best coding practices and principles of object-
oriented design, making it a solid foundation for a banking system simulation.
